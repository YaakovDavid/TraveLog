I Used:


EJS, CSS, PosgeSQL, Express, Path, Body-parser and Method-override.

<br>
<br>

Features I hope to add:


I hope to add a weather api and if posible a map api.

<br>
<br>

Code needing a fix:


Need add a third (join) table so I can update the second table, (or I can get rid of the table completly since it isn't really doing anything)

<br>
<br>

How to run on local server:

clone and run npm install and it should install all dependitcies

<br>
<br>

Part that I'm proud of:


Using css and not bootsrap and within the css making this project mobil friendly.
